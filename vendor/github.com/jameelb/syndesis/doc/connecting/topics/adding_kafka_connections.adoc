= Add a Kafka connection to an integration

You must create a Kafka connection before you can add it to an
integration. If you did not already create a Kafka connection, 
see <<creating-kafka-connections>>. 

The procedure for adding a Kafka connection to an integration varies
according to whether you want to use the Kafka connection to 
obtain data or publish data.
