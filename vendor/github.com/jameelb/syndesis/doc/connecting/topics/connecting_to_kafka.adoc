= Connecting to Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that you can use to
obtain and publish data. 
In an integration, you can subscribe for data from a Kafka topic 
that you specify or publish data to a Kafka topic that you specify.  
To do this, create a connection to Kafka and then add that connection to an 
integration. Details are in the following topics:
